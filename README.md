# Project 4 - Web Scraping for Indeed.com and Predicting Salaries - General Assembly Assignment

- - - - 

During this project, I learned web scraping and utilised the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) libraries to successfully scrape online job listings from Indeed.com.

* Web Scraping: DOM Inspecting + Feature Extraction. 
* Predicting the salary with both a classification & regression model, using features such as location, title, and summary of the job. 
* Identified features in the data related to job postings to distinguish job titles from each other.
* Implemented Classification Models.
 * Logistic regression with both statsmodels and sklearn.
* Coefficients/feature importances evaluaation. 
* Model Evaluation:
  * Used cross-validation to evaluate my models.
  * Evaluated the accuracy, AUC, precision and recall of the models. 
  * Plotted the ROC and precision-recall curve.
* Discussed the differences and explained when a high-recall or a high-precision model scenario is beneficial.
* Obtain the ROC/precision-recall curves for the different models
